So you got a new computer or lost your old settings. Here's how I configure my machines for my development workflow.

```sh
yadm bootstrap
```

     and trackpad tracking speed
    - [ ] Install [Flycut](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flycut-clipboard-manager/id442160987?mt=12) for clipboard management
    - [ ] [Rebind caps lock to escape](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40254864)
    - [ ] Accessibility > enable "scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom"
    - [ ] Install font [Ligconsolata](https://github.com/googlefonts/Inconsolata/tree/master/fonts/otf). This is [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata?selection.family=Inconsolata) but with ligatures.
- [ ] Terminal setup
    - [ ] Install [fzf and enable fuzzy completions](https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/iTerm/fzf.html)
